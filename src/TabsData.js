    title: 'HTML',
    content: `In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN,
    proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE a system for CERN researchers to use
    and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an
    Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote
    the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee
    and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint
    request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN.
    In his personal notes from 1990 he listed some of the many areas in
    which hypertext is used and put an encyclopedia first.The first publicly
    available description of HTML was a document called HTML Tags, first
    mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describe
    18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML.
    Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid,
    an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based
    documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in
    HTML 4. HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and
    compose text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages.
    Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the
    browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web
    page designers additional use of CSS.Many of the text elements are found
    in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which
    in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that
    used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS
    (Compatible Time- Sharing System) operating system: these formatting
    commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually
    format documents.However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is 
    based on elements(nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather
    than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure
    and markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.`,

    title: 'CSS',
    content: `Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language
    used for describing the presentation of a document written in a
    markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology 
    of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed
    to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout,
    colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility,
    provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
    characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying
    the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and
    repetition in the structural content. Separation of formatting and
    content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
    styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print,
    by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based
    tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the 
    content is accessed on a mobile.`,

    title: 'JavaScript',
    content: `JavaScript and Java are two different computer languages, both
    developed in 1995. Java is an object-oriented programming language, which
    means it can run independently in a machine environment. It is a reliable,
    versatile language used for Android apps, enterprise systems that move
    large amounts of data (especially in the finance industry), and embedded
    functions for "Internet of Things" technologies (IoT). JavaScript, on the
    other hand, is a text-based programming language meant to run as part of a
    web-based application. When first developed, it was intended to be a
    compliment to Java. But JavaScript took on a life of its own as one of
    the three pillars of web developmentâ€”the other two being HTML and CSS.
    Unlike Java applications, which need to be compiled before they can run
    in a web-based environment, JavaScript was purposely designed to integrate
    into HTML. All major web browsers support JavaScript, though most give
    users the option of disabling support for it. Using and Writing JavaScript
    What makes JavaScript great is that its not necessary to know how to write
    it to use it in your web code. You can find plenty of prewritten JavaScripts
    for free online. To use such scripts, all you need to know is how to paste
    the supplied code into the right places on your web page. Despite the easy
    access to prewritten scripts, many coders prefer knowing how to do it
    themselves. Because it is an interpreted language, no special program is
    required to create usable code. A plain text editor like Notepad for Windows
    is all you need to write JavaScript. That said, Markdown Editor might make
    the process easier, particularly as the lines of code add up.`,
